    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      At the Waag Society, and Fablab Amsterdam,
      together with Miguel Jimenez and Karim Amhali I have
      developed a 3d laser triangulation scanner.
    </p>

      A short introduction into 3d scanning can be
      found <a href=

      presentation</a> contains lots of
      useful information. The whole setup is built around a webcam,
      a rotation platform and a focussed line laser.
    </p>
    <p>
      By taking pictures of the object from each
      angle while project the laser at the object under a know
      degree, we can determine the position of points in space by
      measuring the distance of the laser line from the center of
      the projection.
    </p>    
    <p>
      In our final design of the scanner, we
      decided to add a number of improvements, such as an arduino
      controlled rotary platform and a second laser projecting at
      the opposite angle, to capture more detail and fill possible
      gaps caused by self-casting shadows from the object.

    <p>
      This document describes in somewhat more detail the construction of a body for the 3d scanner out of
      plywood.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Considerations and partlist</h3>
    <p>
      The current hardware design for our
      prototype has evolved from extensive testing with earlier
      setups. A laser angle of about 30 degrees seems to be the
      most optimal position for the laser, and moving the laser to
      different angles automatically might improve scan quality,
      but increases the complexity of the overal design. Using a
      single laser proved to be insufficient, as objects protubing
      too much in the horizontal plane tend to obscure the laser
      line under certain circumstances. Therefore, a secondary
      laser was added under the opposite angle of -30
      degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitting the lasers rigidly as to stay in
      place during transport is vital for the usability of the
      scanner, since calibrating the whole setup is crucial in
      order to produce good results, but can be quite
      cumbersome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lense of our camera must be centered at
      the exact center of the rotation, but moving the camera up
      and own or closer to the object is needed to scan different
      sized objects, and to move the focus point of the camera to
      the vertical center of each object as much as possible ( to
      produce the best results, an almost “orthogonal projection”
      is the best kind of input.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier designs used plexiglass, this
      current design, however, uses plywood as the base material.
      Plywood is nice to work with, since you can cut, drill and
      sand it into shape very easily, using both the shopbot and
      more conventional tools such as a chisel and a hammer. This
      means the overall material is more flexible and you can work
      around small mistakes or omissions in the design.
    </p>
    <h4>2.1 Platform construction - partlist</h4>
    <p>
      Some of the bolts and screws could be
      exchanged for other parts you may have lying around - it just
      happened to be the pieces we could get our hands on. The SVG
      files for the shopbot also contain holes for the bolts, so
      keep that in mind when taking different sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M6 pins may not have been ideal in this
      case, since a thicker guiding may provide more
      stability.

    <h5>partlist:</h5>

    <h4>2.2 Scanner hardware &nbsp;- partlist</h4>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the part number of the
      original stepper used in our prototypes got lost, but I’ll
      assume the farnel part will do just fine. Also, some exact
      details ( such as the type of white leds ) got lost as they
      were not picked by me. The led mount is made of a plexiglass
      scrap and hot glue. At the current time, I don’t have any
      connection schematics but I will provide them as soon as I
      have constructed the final prototype.

      The shopbot cutter we used was a 6 mm, which
      is pretty precise. The design does not include any
      depth-milling, but smaller is better, since more precise. The
      6mm cutter just happened to be on the machine when I used
      it.

    </p>
    
    <h3>3. Construction</h3>
    <p>
      To explore the capabilities of the shopbot,
      I designed a “snap fit” laser mount and platform fix that
      could be cut out of one piece of plywood and put together as
      an IKEA package.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform consists of three layers: top,
      middle and bottom. The middle layer can be used to guide
      cables and provides extra stabiltiy to the laser mounts,
      &nbsp;the bottom layer is for finishing and fixing the
      electronics. Overall dimensions were choosen to be able to
      fit into a standard size suitcase, in our case the biggest
      affordable aluminum suitcase we could buy at a local hardware
      store. However, to be honest, each layer was designed along
      the way in an iterative process.
    </p>
    <h4>3.1 The Mark One</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57913158@N05/5329341383/in/set-72157625634848655/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5209/5329341383_f5c53cf2c8.jpg" /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the cutting was done, I constructed a
      camera mount out of plywood and some large bolts that could
      be moved up and down by turning a screw. A strong motorcycle
      spring provides some rigidity for t his construction, and it
      proved to be rather stable. &nbsp;I used standard bolts so I
      could fix the bolt heads easily in a cavity on the bottom
      sinde of the the second layer. All this was done by hand,
      improvizing along the way, but most of this work found it’s
      way into the second attempt. Remember to keep a small chisel
      at hand for this type of work! plywood is excellent to work
      with in this way :-)
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57913158@N05/5329952168/in/set-72157625634848655/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5050/5329952168_bab2f60079.jpg" /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once this was finished, I started to fix the
      lasers on their mounts, this is where I realised something
      had gone wrong in the milling - the cavities for the lasers
      were too large. I finally found out that this was caused by
      the transition from inkscape SVG to illustrator, for some
      strange reason. This can be avoided by using .eps as an
      intermediate format.
    </p>    
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57913158@N05/5329952168/in/set-72157625634848655/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5284/5329955202_b981f60c31.jpg" /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I improvised again, by drilling 12mm holes
      into the other side of the mounts. ( it is very important to
      do a precise job here, since the laser angles must be know
      and exact! ). I calibrated and ensured that the lasers were
      at a straight 30 degree angle by switching them on. The two
      lines should merge at exactly the center of your rotary
      platform! Again, some of this was improvised in the first
      attempt, for example by adding a layer of black ducktape
      around the laser casing to allow for more grip.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57913158@N05/5329344727/in/set-72157625634848655/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5210/5329344727_983b49b84f.jpg" /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, it was time to fix the camera
      onto the mount. The packaging of the 9000 pro is not the most
      ideal for this setup, as it is hard to center the lens and
      keep the whole thing straight and horizontal. One important
      thing to do here is to switch on the lasers and camera, and
      keep looking at the picture. I’ve written a small python
      script that shows a line trough the center of the image, and
      while reassuring that everything stays straight and centered
      by looking at the screen, I fixed both camera’s, laser and
      platform in one go.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h4>3.2 Lessons learned: the Mark II</h4>
    <p>
      From the inital built, I learned
      that:
    </p>    
    <ol>
      <li>
        The shopbot is much more precise then I
        had anticipated. don’t hand-drill. trust the
        shopbot!
      </li>
      <li>
        The camera mount works pretty reliable for
        up-and-down movement. However, moving along the Z axis is a
        very nice to have, since it’ll allow for scanning small
        objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        The snap-fit approach works pretty nice,
        and plywood is sturdy anough for this purpose

      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      Altough the “Mark One” can be used within
      the project I intended it for, I’ve started work on an
      improved design ( this time without the scaling bug ) that
      will actually fit the suitcase as intended.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started out by making a constructive test
      of a Z-Y axis mount, much like a CNC milling machine
      provides.
    </p>
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57913158@N05/5329962074/in/set-72157625634811369/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5281/5329962074_13ec42f365.jpg"/></a>
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57913158@N05/5329348537/in/set-72157625634811369/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5008/5329348537_6a85fbb61a.jpg"/></a>    
    <p>
      This mount eventually made it into the next
      design, the top layer already cut.
